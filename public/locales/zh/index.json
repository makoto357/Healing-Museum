  "paragraph1": "TheHealing Museum is an online experience inspired by two concepts: art as therapy” and “museum on prescription”. The former has its root in the 19th century psychologists’ theories and their perspective of “artistic expression as a window into the inner workings of the mind”, while the latter considers museums as places with potential to facilitate the healing process as well as serving as social prescriptions to complement primary medical care.",
  "paragraph2": "Art as healing means to direct personal or traumatic experiences towards creative expressions of who you are, how you feel and what you identify with. By presenting the artworks of 3 female and 3 male modern artists, who have shared their visions of realities and transcended their adversities into ever-lasting arts, the Healing Museum aims to explore the source of their strength and learn about resilience.",
